# Eko Football — Rules Q&A

## 1. How does a player get clean sheet points?

**Answer:** Clean sheet points are **per fixture**, not per matchday. For each **completed fixture** in which **their group** does not concede any goals (i.e. the group keeps a clean sheet in that game), every member of that group gets **+1 rating point**. So if a group keeps clean sheets in two fixtures during a matchday, all members get +2 points (one per fixture). Career “clean sheets” count is the total number of such fixtures (not matchdays).

## 2. Does the fixture have to be finished before a player can get the clean sheet point for that fixture?

**Answer:** **Yes.** The clean sheet for a fixture is applied only when that fixture is **completed** (status `completed` and goals recorded). So once a fixture is ended, if the group conceded 0 in that fixture, all members of that group get +1 for that fixture.
